A tower or stack light (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_light) that 
indicates the status of our CI Build System
This tower.py script is a simple script that lives on a lighttpd server, and 
changes various GPIO pins to reflect the state passed in a JSON message

Use
===

Simply PUT or POST a JSON string to tower.py
ie, {"status":"green", "flash":"yes"}

If you omit a colour, you will get an error back in response. It accepts
"green", "amber", "red", and "off"

It optionally accepts the "flash" parameter. If yes, it will flash during the 
transition. Anything else results in no flashes.

Hardware
========

1x Bifferboard
1x Tower or Stack Light - http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/121368679027
3x 2n7000 MOSFETs
1x PSU

Software
========

Configure lighttpd to start by default with <code>/etc/init.d/lighttpd enable</code>

Place tower.py into /www/ and configure Lighttpd as below

Place a reference to /root/ci_tower/setup.sh (or wherever you've checked this out
to) in /etc/rc.local in order to have the GPIO pins configured on boot.

tower.py is a very dumb and simple python script that reads from stdin, and 
passes it onto a JSON handler. Afterwards, it just fiddles various GPIO pins 
to obtain the desired effect.

Lighttpd Configuration
======================
Some modifications to the default config are required.

Enable mod_cgi and mod_setenv
Permit Access-Control-Allow-Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Methods, and 
Access-Control-Allow-Headers headers
Configure Lighttpd to pass .py files onto /usr/bin/python
